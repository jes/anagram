        <h4>An extension of your brain that helps you find anagrams.</h4>

        <p>
        Anagram Deputy helps you find anagrams. It is <b>not</b> an
        anagram solver in its own right. There are <a href="http://anagram-solver.net/">lots</a>

        <a href="http://www.crossword-dictionary.com/anagram.asp">anagram</a> <a href="http://www.oneacross.com/anagrams/">solvers</a> available if that
        is what you're looking for. Anagram Deputy typically allows you to
        find better anagrams, by augmenting your language processing
        abilities with your computer's search and keeping-track-of-lots-of-letters abilities.
        </p>

        <p>
        In the top box, enter the phrase you're trying to find an anagram for.
        The letters available appear in blue, in a scrambled order. Start working on the
        anagram in the second box. The blue letters show you which letters are
        still remaining, and the small words underneath show you options for
        completing the word you're typing (or a new word, if none). Greyed-out
        suggestions are words that can be made, but with which a full anagram
        can not be made using the words in the dictionary. These are sometimes
        still useful in case you can use words that are not in the dictionary (e.g.
        names).
        </p>

        <p>
        You can hit Ctrl to rescramble the blue letters.
